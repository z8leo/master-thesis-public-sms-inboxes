## Abstract
This thesis examines public SMS inboxes that are free-to-use websites offering phone
numbers and enabling users to receive SMS messages sent to those numbers. These
services get used for malicious and benevolent actions, which results in various threats to
users, internet services and third parties.
By incorporating evidence from third-party data sources and a set of 14 million SMS
messages scraped from ten websites, we examined the ecosystem of public SMS inboxes
end-to-end. We uncovered that these websites share numbers and, to some extent, rely
on illegal SIM boxes. We conclude that websites offering public SMS inboxes are not
legitimate businesses. Their services facilitate cybercrime mainly by providing phone
numbers as free resources for phone-verified account evasion at internet services while also
serving legitimate privacy-related use cases. The threats posed by public SMS inboxes
can be mitigated by checking phone number reputation and other countermeasures.
